            <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
              As enterprise asset management (EAM) systems become more interconnected and mission-critical, integrating IBM Maximo with modern security and data intelligence platforms is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. But integrating Maximo into your security operations stack isn't as straightforward as plugging in a SIEM or API connector.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
              That's why we built Data Trei—a next-generation cybersecurity and intelligence platform purpose-built for Maximo-driven environments. Below, we share integration best practices for IBM Maximo that improve security posture, streamline operations, and unlock real-time insights—while spotlighting how Data Trei supports each step.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">1. Connect Telemetry from Across the Stack</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Ingest data from Maximo, but also from the broader environment (e.g. ServiceNow, Salesforce, Slack, SCADA systems).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              Our Connect module makes it easy to securely ingest logs, alerts, and operational data from Maximo and adjacent platforms. This creates a unified threat surface and lays the foundation for cross-system correlation. Real-time ingestion supports both on-prem and cloud-hosted Maximo instances.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">2. Correlate Multi-Source Signals to Detect Emerging Threats</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Avoid relying on Maximo logs in isolation. Context is key for identifying risks that span IT and OT domains.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              Our Multi-Source Correlation Engine maps behaviors across Maximo and other enterprise platforms using semantic LLM embeddings. This enables teams to detect slow-moving attacks or policy violations that wouldn't be flagged in siloed tools.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">3. Use LLMs to Summarize Logs and Accelerate Triage</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Replace manual log triage with automated, explainable insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              The LLM-Powered Log Intelligence module auto-summarizes complex logs from Maximo environments and translates them into human-readable alerts. Security analysts can now understand what happened, why it matters, and what to do next—without digging through endless XML exports.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">4. Detect and Act on Anomalous Behavior in Real Time</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Pair anomaly detection with playbooks that reduce Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              Our Anomaly Detection & Early Warning System uses behavioral baselining to spot unusual user access, asset behavior, and configuration changes in Maximo. Detected anomalies can trigger agentic workflows via our Co-Pilot module—automating alert routing, ticket creation, or enforcement actions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">5. Report on Security and Compliance Automatically</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Generate compliance-friendly, audit-ready reports that align with industry frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              Our Report module auto-generates executive summaries, audit logs, and compliance dashboards tailored to industries like energy, transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare. Data Trei helps you reduce audit prep time from weeks to minutes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">6. Continuously Tune Your Threat Model</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Integration is not a one-time event—continuously evolve your detection logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>With Data Trei:</strong><br />
              The Optimize stage of our pipeline allows security teams to fine-tune anomaly thresholds, update detection rules, and integrate analyst feedback into the AI model's learning loop.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-medium">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              IBM Maximo is the digital heartbeat of many enterprises—but it's often underprotected. Integration with security operations platforms must go beyond basic log shipping or static dashboards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Data Trei brings Maximo into the future with AI-powered correlation, anomaly detection, and real-time log intelligence. Whether you're securing power grids, airports, manufacturing lines, or hospitals—Data Trei helps your team see more, act faster, and operate smarter.
